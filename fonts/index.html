    <p class="p4">Plot
        In 3102 BC, following the Kurukshetra War, Ashwatthama attempts to kill Uttarā's child in her womb by invoking the Brahmashirastra. For this act, Krishna curses him to roam the earth as an immortal. His divine gem is also taken from his forehead, and his redemption is destined to occur through assisting Vishnu's last avatar, Kalki, during the Kali Yuga.</p>
    <p class="p5">By 2898 AD, six thousand years into the Kali Yuga, the desertified city of Kasi stands as the last known city in a post-apocalyptic world dominated by Supreme Yaskin, a totalitarian god-king. Yaskin rules from the "Complex," an inverted-pyramidal-megastructure that hovers above the city, extracting Earth's resources to sustain a gated paradise accessible only to those who can pay 1 million "units." His authority is enforced by Commander Manas and Counsellor Bani, who vigilantly guards against threats, particularly the prophesied arrival of Kalki.</p>
